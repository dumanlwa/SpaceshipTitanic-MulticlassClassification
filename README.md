# Developed a predictive model for the Spaceship Titanic Dataset to determine whether passengers were transported
to another dimension.
• Conducted thorough data cleaning, processing, and exploratory data analysis to ensure dataset reliability and
accuracy, as well as to gain insight into the variabels and relationships within the dataset.
• Utilized the Sequential Floating Forward Selection method to identify the most relevant features for the predictive
model.
• Experimented with multiple classification algorithms ( Logistic regression, KNeighbors Classifier, Support Vector
Machine, Random Forest Classifier, LGBM Classifier, and CatBoost Classifier) to determine the best model for
predicting
